# Simple JavaScript Drills

This project is designed to help you get used to writing functions in JavaScript and thinking about logic. There are tests in the "tests" directory.

Once you have completed the methods and you think they are correct, you can run `npm test` from the command line to see if your code passes the tests.

## Getting Started

`npm install`

### To run all tests

`npm test`

### To run specific tests

`npm run test:arrays`

`npm run test:objects`

`npm run test:numbers`

`npm run test:strings`
